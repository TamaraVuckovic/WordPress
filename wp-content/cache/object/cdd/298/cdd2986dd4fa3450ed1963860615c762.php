Luckily there are plenty of new and improved cooling beds for dogs that help give them relief during the hottest of days. A cooling bed is usually filled with either gel or water and works best when kept out of direct sunlight. Most dogs will take a few days to get used to the pad.

Though this mat may look just like the other gel pads, the Self Cooling™ pad bed has been designed to fit onto couches perfectly – which makes sense, considering that’s where pets love to hang out.

It’s also super easy to clean and extra thick, making it ideal for households with dogs that shed…a lot, or households with dogs who love to chew!";s:10:"post_title";s:23:"Self Cooling™ pad bed";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:20:"self-cooling-pad-bed";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2022-09-18 12:06:57";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2022-09-18 12:06:57";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:73:"https://tvuckovic.wppsbootcamp.com/projekat/?post_type=product&#038;p=125";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:7:"product";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
